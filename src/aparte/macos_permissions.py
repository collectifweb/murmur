"""macOS privacy (TCC) probes: microphone authorization and Accessibility trust.

The first native PyObjC module in the project. It is imported only on Darwin
(from :func:`aparte.diagnostics._collect_checks_macos`) and every call degrades
to an "unknown" answer rather than raising: a diagnostic must never be the thing
that crashes ``aparte doctor``. Because this code cannot run on the Linux dev
machine, its real behaviour is verified by hand on a Mac; the unit tests here
only pin the mapping and the graceful-degradation contract by mocking the
frameworks.

The two *probes* — :func:`microphone_authorization` and
:func:`accessibility_trusted` — never prompt: they are the no-dialog reads used
by diagnostics. The *guided Accessibility parcours* (M3) does prompt:
:func:`guide_accessibility_once` shows the grant dialog and opens the Settings
pane, and is called by :func:`aparte.clipboard.paste_text` when insertion needs
Accessibility and it is known-denied.
