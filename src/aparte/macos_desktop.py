"""macOS application bundle (M7) — everything decidable, decided here.

On Mac the permission dialogs today say *Terminal*, because Terminal is what launches
Python, and TCC attributes a request to the **responsible** process — the bundle
LaunchServices started. Wrapping Aparté in a real ``.app`` is what makes them say
*Aparté* instead. That is the whole point of this module.

**The main executable is a Mach-O binary, never a script.** Apple DTS is explicit
(developer.apple.com/forums/thread/678819): *"TCC expects its bundled clients … to use a
native main executable. … If your product uses a script as its main executable, you're
likely to encounter TCC problems."* So :func:`launcher_source` emits a small C program,
compiled on the user's machine by the Homebrew formula with the command-line tools
Homebrew already requires. Nothing here is downloaded as an application, so nothing is
ever quarantined and Gatekeeper has nothing to examine.

**The bundle must not change between two versions of Aparté.** An ad-hoc signature has no
team identity: the requirement TCC stores is pinned to the code's ``cdhash``. If the
bundle changes, macOS forgets the permissions — *and the checkbox stays ticked in System
Settings*, so the failure is silent. Hence: no Aparté version in the bundle, no Python
code in the bundle, and the interpreter named through Homebrew's version-stable ``opt``
path rather than the ``Cellar`` path that moves on every upgrade. ``brew upgrade``
replaces the prefix and never touches the bundle.

Everything in this module is pure string and path work, so it is proved on the Linux dev
machine. What cannot be proved here — LaunchServices, ``codesign``, and the TCC
attribution itself — is measured on a real Mac by the M7-0 probe.
