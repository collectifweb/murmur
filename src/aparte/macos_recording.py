"""macOS in-process recording — the resident server's toggle state machine.

On Linux the global shortcut spawns short-lived CLI recorders that coordinate
through a session file, ``os.link`` and ``/proc`` (:mod:`aparte.session`). That
only makes sense because a gsettings shortcut has no process of its own.

On macOS the global shortcut (M5) *needs* a resident process, and one already
exists: the desktop server, autostarted at login. So recording happens **in the
server's memory** — no subprocess, no PID, no session file, no ``/proc`` — through
this :class:`RecordingController`. It is less code than transposing
:mod:`aparte.session`, not more.

Native (PortAudio via ``sounddevice``), so it cannot run on the Linux dev machine:
the unit tests inject a fake ``sounddevice`` and a fake ``transcribe_fn`` and lock
the **observable** contract — the state transitions, the bounded real-time
callback, the post-capture order. The real capture is verified by hand on a Mac
(M8).

The controller is built with every dependency **injected** so it stays pure and
testable:

- ``transcribe_fn(wav) -> str`` — server-local **raw** transcription. The desktop
  wiring builds it to take the single ``inference_lock`` and reuse the one cached
  Whisper model, never a self-HTTP call. Polishing (French typography) happens in
  the worker, after transcription — not in this primitive.
- ``settings_provider() -> Settings`` — re-read each recording, so a config change
  (device, beep, cap, polish) takes effect without a restart.

Nothing here is triggered in M4: the shortcut that calls :meth:`toggle` is M5. In
M4 this is dormant infrastructure, proven by mocked tests, wired to a trigger in
M5 and read by the tray in M6.
