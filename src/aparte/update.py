"""Update Aparté in place, from the git checkout it runs from.

There is no release binary to download and no update server: an install is a
clone plus `pip install -e .`, so an update is a fast-forward plus the same
install command. What needs care is refusing the situations where moving would
lose work or silently do nothing.

**Releases, not commits.** The unit of update is a version tag, never the tip of
the tracked branch. A `docs:` typo pushed to `main` is not something to notify
anyone about, and landing on an arbitrary commit hands out a half-finished
feature. Tags are read with git, not from a hosting API: the install is already
a clone, the release notes already live in `CHANGELOG.md`, and asking a web
service would add a network dependency and a failure mode for information the
repository already carries.

Nothing here touches the network unless it is asked to: `check_update()` only
fetches when told to, so opening the diagnostics panel stays offline.
