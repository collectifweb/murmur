"""macOS run loop + global-shortcut lifecycle for the resident server (M5b).

``RegisterEventHotKey`` only delivers events while a live AppKit run loop pumps
them, and that run loop must own the main thread. So on macOS the HTTP server
moves to a daemon thread (exactly as it does under the GTK tray on Linux) and
this module runs the AppKit loop on the main thread, owning the whole shortcut
lifecycle:

    NSApplication ready → register hotkey → run loop (blocks) → ordered teardown

Since M6 the loop is usually **rumps'**: a menu-bar tray is an ``NSStatusItem`` on
the same single run loop, and ``rumps.App.run()`` is ``AppHelper.runEventLoop()``
under another name. So the tray provides the runner and this module keeps everything
else. The teardown moved out of the ``finally`` and into a named, idempotent function
for one blunt reason: rumps quits through ``NSApplication.terminate_``, which never
returns from ``run()`` — a ``finally`` alone would never fire on the normal way out.

Three seams keep it testable on the Linux dev machine, where no run loop exists:

- ``run_loop(on_ready, on_quit)`` — the real one is the injected default; a test
  passes a fake that fires ``on_ready`` (the moment registration must happen) then
  returns.
- ``register`` — the real Carbon façade by default; a fake in tests.
- ``tray_factory`` — :func:`aparte.macos_tray.build_tray` by default; a fake tray in
  tests, and ``None`` on a Mac without rumps installed.

The native AppKit/Carbon imports live inside :func:`_appkit_run_loop`, reached
only on a real Mac; the module itself stays importable everywhere.
