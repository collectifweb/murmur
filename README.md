Aparté is a local-first dictation app for Linux. It can run as a CLI, as a command bound to a global keyboard shortcut, or as a lightweight local desktop web app.

Nothing leaves your machine: Whisper runs locally, formatting runs locally, and
there is no account, no API key, and no network call. It is also the only
dictation app that takes **French typography** seriously — non-breaking spaces
before `? ! ; :`, real `« »` quotes, curly apostrophes.

The loop, in four steps:

1. Capture speech or accept an audio file.
2. Transcribe with a local Whisper backend.
3. Polish the raw transcript with punctuation, capitalization, filler cleanup, lists, and optional local LLM formatting.
4. Copy or paste the result into the active Linux desktop session.

## Screenshots

![Aparté dictation screen](docs/screenshots/main.png)

One screen: a Talk button, a transcript editor, and nothing else in the way. The
transcript is set in a serif face, so the French typography Aparté produces is
actually visible — look at the `« »`, the curly apostrophes, and the spacing
before `;` and `?`.

![Aparté while recording](docs/screenshots/recording.png)

Aparté follows your desktop's light or dark theme. While the microphone is open,
the button is the only saturated thing on screen — you can tell it is recording
from the corner of your eye, and without relying on colour alone (the icon and
the label change too).

Grouped settings and built-in setup diagnostics — the diagnostics show what is
installed and the exact command to fix anything missing, so any Linux user can
get set up without the terminal. The interface is available in English and French.

## Current status

Aparté is in daily use: dictate with a global shortcut, and the text lands
formatted in whichever app is focused. Text polishing and the desktop UI work
out of the box; audio transcription activates when one of these local backends
is available:

- `faster-whisper` Python package (recommended — the only one that supports the
  **My words** vocabulary setting)
- `openai-whisper` Python package
- `whisper.cpp` CLI via `APARTE_WHISPER_CPP`

For best formatting quality, run Ollama locally and set `APARTE_POLISH_BACKEND=ollama`.
For consistent spelling of names, products, and acronyms, use **My words** and
**Corrections** in Settings — see [Teaching Aparté your vocabulary](#teaching-aparté-your-vocabulary).

Still to come: a floating window so the live preview is visible when you dictate
with the global shortcut rather than only inside the app, and capturing a
correction straight from the editor instead of retyping it in Settings.

## Install

Two ways to install. The script is the easy path; the manual venv install gives you more control.

### Option A — guided script (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/collectifweb/aparte.git
cd aparte
./scripts/install-linux.sh                       # Whisper + recording + default config + desktop launcher (icon/menu)
./scripts/install-linux.sh --with-system-deps    # also apt-installs the recording/clipboard/paste tools
```

The script auto-adds GPU support (the `cuda` extra) when it detects an NVIDIA GPU,
and registers the desktop icon/menu entry for you.

### Option B — manual venv install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/collectifweb/aparte.git
cd aparte
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[whisper,recording]"  # add ,cuda for NVIDIA GPUs — see "GPU acceleration" below
```

This `[whisper,recording]` baseline is what makes Aparté an actual dictation app:
`whisper` enables transcription and `recording` enables microphone capture. A bare
`pip install -e .` only gives you text polishing and the desktop UI — it cannot
transcribe or record.

Then verify the setup and install the desktop launcher (the manual path does **not**
add the icon/menu entry by itself — only `install-linux.sh` does):

```bash
aparte doctor            # green/red status for every dependency, with the fix command for each gap
aparte install-desktop   # add the app icon + menu entry (use --print to preview the entry first)
```

### Updating an existing install

Open the desktop app, click **Setup**, and use the **Update** section at the
bottom: it checks the remote when you press Check, tells you which version is
waiting, moves to it, reinstalls, and restarts Aparté. It refuses — and says why
— when the folder has uncommitted changes, when the branch tracks no remote, or
when Aparté wasn't installed from a clone.

**It follows releases, not commits.** The panel only offers you a published
version — a `vX.Y.Z` tag — and updating fast-forwards to that tag rather than to
whatever happens to be at the tip of `main`. A typo fix pushed between two
releases will not prompt you to reinstall, and you will never land mid-way
through a feature that is still being written. If you are running a checkout
that sits ahead of the newest tag, the panel says you are up to date, because
unreleased commits are work in progress rather than an update.

To do it by hand instead, pull the latest code **in the folder you already
cloned** and re-run the script — don't clone a second copy:

```bash
cd aparte          # the directory you installed into
git pull
./scripts/install-linux.sh
```

Re-running is safe: the existing `.venv` is reused, dependencies are upgraded in
place, and config init is a no-op. Cloning Aparté again into a new folder instead
leaves you with two separate installs (each with its own multi-GB `.venv`) and a
desktop launcher and autostart entry that can point at different copies.

On a manual venv install (Option B), update with:

```bash
cd aparte
git pull
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[whisper,recording]"   # add ,cuda for NVIDIA GPUs
```

> If `git pull` reports *"no tracking information for the current branch"*, you're
> on a local branch that was never pushed. Switch to `main` first
> (`git checkout main`), then pull.

### Upgrading from Murmur (the previous name)

Pull and re-run the install script as above; the rename is handled for you:

- `~/.config/murmur/config.json` is moved to `~/.config/aparte/config.json` on
  first run, so your settings, replacements, and snippets carry over.
- `MURMUR_*` environment variables are still read as a fallback, so existing
  shell profiles and scripts keep working.
- The old `murmur` command still runs Aparté, so a global shortcut bound to the
  old binary keeps working. It is deprecated and will be removed later — re-run
  `aparte install-hotkey` to repoint the shortcut at the new command.
- The old desktop launcher, icon, and autostart entry are removed when you
  re-run `aparte install-desktop` / `aparte install-autostart`, so you don't end
  up with two menu entries or two servers competing at login.
- A Murmur server still running from before the update is stopped and its port
  taken over the next time you launch Aparté. Those entries are removed as
  files, but a server started at a previous login keeps running until you log
  out — and once the update has moved its files, it answers its API from memory
  while serving 404 for its own page. Without this, launching Aparté handed you
  over to it and opened the browser on that error page.

### Extras, à la carte

| Extra        | Adds                                                                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `whisper`    | `faster-whisper` transcription backend (required for dictation)       |
| `recording`  | microphone capture via `sounddevice` (required for live dictation)    |
| `cuda`       | NVIDIA GPU acceleration — see *GPU acceleration* below                |

### System packages

```bash
sudo apt install alsa-utils ffmpeg wl-clipboard wtype xclip xdotool
```

Use Wayland tools (`wl-copy`, `wtype`) on Wayland, or X11 tools (`xclip`, `xdotool`) on X11.

### GPU acceleration (NVIDIA, optional)

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[whisper,recording,cuda]"
```

This installs the CUDA runtime libraries as pip wheels **inside the venv** — no
system CUDA toolkit and no driver changes, so it will not touch the GPU drivers your
games or other apps rely on. The app preloads the libraries automatically, so GPU
transcription works without setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and **falls back to CPU
automatically** when CUDA is unusable.

Confirm the GPU is actually used (not merely installed):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c "import ctranslate2; print(ctranslate2.get_cuda_device_count())"
```

`> 0` means the GPU will be used; `0` means CPU fallback. Note that `aparte doctor`'s
"GPU acceleration (CUDA): ok" only confirms the CUDA libraries are importable — not
that a device is reachable at runtime. Use the command above, or watch `nvidia-smi`
during a dictation, to be sure. On older cards (Pascal / GTX 10-series), set
`APARTE_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8`: the `auto` default picks `float16`, which is slow on those
GPUs.

## CLI examples

Polish raw text:

```bash
echo "hey sarah thanks for sending this euh i will review it tomorrow" | aparte polish
```

Transcribe an audio file and polish it:

```bash
aparte transcribe meeting.wav --polish
```

Record from the microphone, transcribe, polish, and copy:

```bash
aparte record --seconds 15 --polish --copy
```

Dictate directly into the active app:

```bash
aparte dictate --seconds 8
```

Use fixed-duration dictation as a global keyboard shortcut command in GNOME/KDE/XFCE:

```bash
aparte dictate --seconds 8 --target paste
```

For a more Flow-like shortcut, bind the same toggle command to one global hotkey. The first press starts recording; the second press stops, transcribes, polishes, and inserts:

```bash
aparte toggle --target paste
```

Check whether a toggle recording is already active:

```bash
aparte toggle --status
```

If direct paste is unavailable on your desktop, copy instead:

```bash
aparte toggle --target copy
```

Launch the Linux desktop app:

```bash
aparte desktop
```

Install a desktop launcher in `~/.local/share/applications`:

```bash
aparte install-desktop
```

Run the desktop server automatically at login (writes `~/.config/autostart`).
It starts in the background without opening a browser, so the editor and the
Settings tab are always available at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`:

```bash
aparte install-autostart
aparte install-autostart --remove   # undo
```

## Global hotkey (recommended for dictating into other apps)

The Flow-like flow is one global shortcut bound to `toggle`: press once to start,
press again to transcribe and insert into whatever app is focused (Slack, email,
…). The binding is stored by your desktop and survives reboots, so no background
process is required for it.

On Cinnamon and GNOME, Aparté can register the shortcut for you:

```bash
aparte install-hotkey                            # bind Super+Space to toggle dictation
aparte install-hotkey --key '<Control><Alt>d'    # pick another accelerator
aparte install-hotkey --print                    # show what it would bind, without applying
aparte install-hotkey --remove                   # remove it
```

It allocates a custom keybinding through `gsettings`, reusing the same slot on
re-runs so it never piles up duplicates. A bare `install-hotkey` keeps an
already-chosen key; only `--key` moves it.

On other desktops, add the shortcut yourself (System Settings → Keyboard →
Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts → Add) with this command — use the full path to the
binary inside your venv:

```bash
/path/to/aparte/.venv/bin/aparte toggle --target paste
```

Then assign a key (e.g. a spare key or `Super+Space`). Direct paste needs
`xdotool` on X11 or `wtype` on Wayland; otherwise use `--target copy` and paste
with `Ctrl+V`. Desktop notifications show when recording starts and stops.

Open **Setup** in `aparte desktop` to check the binding: the **Keyboard
shortcut** card shows whether the shortcut is bound and to which key, the
one-command auto-bind, and the exact `toggle` command to bind by hand — each with
a copy button.

Create and inspect your config:

```bash
aparte config init     # write a default config.json
aparte config path     # print its location
aparte config show     # print the active (merged) config
```

There is no `config set` command. To change settings persistently, edit the JSON
file printed by `aparte config path`, or use the **Settings** panel in `aparte
desktop` — it writes to the same file and applies immediately, including to the
global-hotkey flow.

## Configuration

Environment variables:

```bash
APARTE_TRANSCRIBER=auto
APARTE_RECORDER=auto
APARTE_MODEL=small
APARTE_DEVICE=auto
APARTE_COMPUTE_TYPE=auto
APARTE_LANGUAGE=
APARTE_POLISH_BACKEND=heuristic
APARTE_PASTE_MODE=clipboard
APARTE_MICROPHONE=
APARTE_RUNTIME_DIR=
APARTE_OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
APARTE_OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
APARTE_WHISPER_CPP=
APARTE_CONFIG=
```

`APARTE_DEVICE` controls the `faster-whisper` compute device (`auto`, `cpu`, or `cuda`).
When a GPU is detected but its CUDA runtime is missing or unusable
(`libcublas`/`libcudnn` not found), transcription automatically falls back to CPU
with `int8`, so it works out of the box on machines without a CUDA install.
Force CPU with `APARTE_DEVICE=cpu` to skip the GPU probe entirely.

Polish backends:

- `heuristic`: fully local, no model required, good enough for punctuation and capitalization cleanup.
- `ollama`: local LLM rewrite through Ollama, much better for fillers, backtracking, tone, and context.

### System tray icon

Running the desktop app puts an Aparté icon in the system tray: three bars at
rest, a filled disc while the microphone is open, and a menu to open the app,
copy the last dictation, jump to Settings, or quit.

It relies on PyGObject and the AppIndicator typelib, which are system packages
rather than pip ones:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1
```

`./scripts/install-linux.sh --with-system-deps` installs them for you, and the
script creates the virtualenv with `--system-site-packages` so it can see them.

A virtualenv created before this change cannot see them, but it does not need
rebuilding — one line in `.venv/pyvenv.cfg` is enough, which keeps the
multi-gigabyte Whisper and CUDA packages already installed:

```
include-system-site-packages = true
```

Re-running the install script does this for you. `aparte doctor` also names this
case specifically, because the alternative failure — PyGObject genuinely not
installed — needs the opposite move, and following the wrong one is a dead end:
`apt install` answers "already the newest version" while the icon stays missing.

Without the bindings, Aparté starts exactly as it did before, and `aparte doctor`
tells you what is missing.

### Recent dictations

The last five dictations sit under the action bar in the desktop app; click one
to copy it. From a terminal, `aparte last` prints the most recent one and
`aparte last --target paste` re-inserts it into the focused window.

They live in the runtime directory (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aparte`, which is tmpfs and
wiped when you log out), because a dictation can carry a password or a private
message. Tick **Keep history between sessions** in Settings — or set
`history_persist` in the config — to write them to `~/.local/state/aparte`
instead, in a file only you can read.

Every Aparté process shares that one store, so a dictation made through the
global hotkey shows up in the app, and vice versa, without either one having to
be running for the other.

Insertion modes (`paste_mode` in the config, or **How to insert** under
**Hardware** in the desktop app). Every mode copies the dictation to the
clipboard first, so it is never lost when the insertion lands somewhere
unexpected:

- `clipboard` (default): one atomic `Ctrl+V`. Right nearly everywhere.
- `terminal`: `Ctrl+Shift+V` — terminals ignore `Ctrl+V` entirely.
- `direct`: types the text out. For apps that refuse a synthetic paste
  (LibreOffice, some Electron apps). Slower, and a stray click mid-insertion can
  scatter it.

### Choosing a microphone

**Input device**, under **Hardware** in Settings, lists what ALSA can capture
from — pick one, or leave it on the system default. **Refresh** rebuilds the
list without closing the panel, for a microphone plugged in after opening it. A device that has since been
unplugged stays in the list, marked as such, rather than being silently swapped
for another one.

It applies to the global shortcut and to the terminal commands (`microphone` in
the config, an ALSA name such as `plughw:CARD=Mini,DEV=0`). The desktop app's
**Talk** button records through the browser, so it follows whichever microphone
the browser is set to.

Tick **Beep on start and stop** (`beep`) for two short tones — a high one when
the microphone opens, a lower one when it closes. It is off by default; turn it
on if you dictate with the global shortcut without watching the screen.

### Preview while you speak

**Preview while dictating** (`live_preview`, on by default) shows the transcript
building up in the editor instead of leaving you talking into the void. Roughly
once a second, whatever has been recorded so far is transcribed again from the
start and the result replaces the previous pass — which is also why the text
corrects itself as you go: Whisper revises its own guesses once it has heard the
end of the sentence. Preview text is shown in lighter ink and the action buttons
stay off, because it is not the final version yet; auto-polish only runs at the
end, on the final transcript.

Never more than one pass at a time: the next one is scheduled when the previous
one comes back. On a slow machine that means fewer previews, never a queue. Even
so, without a GPU this keeps one core busy for as long as you speak — untick the
setting if the machine struggles. As a side effect, the first preview loads the
Whisper model while you are still talking, so the wait after you stop is shorter.

### Recordings stop on their own after five minutes

`max_recording_seconds` (config file only, 300 by default) is the longest a
single shortcut recording can run. It exists because a microphone left open has
no other reason to stop: one forgotten recording reached 31 minutes and 59 MB
before anyone noticed.

At the ceiling the recorder exits cleanly, and the next press of the shortcut
transcribes what it captured — so hitting the limit truncates a dictation, it
does not lose one. Any unreadable or non-positive value falls back to 300; there
is deliberately no "unlimited" setting, because a typo would otherwise reopen
exactly the problem this prevents. If you genuinely dictate for two hours, write
`7200`.

### The shortcut reuses the running app's model

Pressing the global shortcut used to start a fresh process that read the Whisper
model off disk on every dictation, while the desktop app already held it in
memory. The shortcut now hands its audio to that running app when one answers on
the loopback address: 0.26 s instead of 1.53 s for the same ten seconds of audio.

Nothing leaves the machine — it is the same local address the browser talks to.
When the desktop app is not running, the shortcut loads its own model exactly as
before, so dictation never depends on it. Delegation is also skipped when an
`APARTE_*` transcription override is set in the environment, since the running
app reads the config file and would ignore it.

### Invented subtitle credits are removed

Whisper was trained on subtitled video. On silence — the tail of a dictation, a
pause, a microphone picking up nothing — it does not return an empty string: it
fills the gap with a subtitling credit seen thousands of times during training.
In French the usual one is `Sous-titres réalisés par la communauté d'Amara.org`.

Aparté strips the known credits from every transcript, whichever path produced it.
Credits carrying a domain or a broadcaster name are removed wherever they appear;
generic video sign-offs such as `Merci d'avoir regardé cette vidéo`, which someone
writing a video script may genuinely dictate, are only removed when they make up
the whole transcript. When in doubt nothing moves — a normal dictation comes back
unchanged, and `Amara.org` on its own is deliberately not in the list.

### French typography

Aparté is built for dictating in French, so the formatting rules follow French
typography rather than the English ones:

- a non-breaking space before `? ! ;` and `:` — but not inside `https://` or `14:30`
- `«  »` instead of straight double quotes, when they pair up
- a typographic apostrophe: `l'ami` → `l’ami`
- standalone `i` is left alone (upper-casing it is the English pronoun rule)

Which set applies follows the **Dictation language** setting. On `Auto`, the
language is guessed from the text itself, so French typography works without
setting anything — but pinning the setting to `Français` is more reliable, and
it also stops Whisper from drifting to another language.

Set `"nonbreaking_spaces": false` in the config to use ordinary spaces instead of
non-breaking ones, for apps that handle them poorly.

**Numbers dictated in words become digits** (`numbers_from`, French only). Whisper
already writes digits about half the time; the point is that the same sentence
dictated twice comes out the same way. The setting is the threshold below which a
number stays in words — 10 by default, which is the French rule:

- "vingt-deux personnes" → "22 personnes", "quatre-vingt-dix-sept" → "97",
  "l'an deux mille vingt-six" → "l'an 2026" (a year keeps its four digits
  together; the thousands separator starts at five)
- times and percentages always become digits, whatever the threshold:
  "quatorze heures trente" → "14 h 30", "vingt pour cent" → "20 %"
- "deux millions" keeps its word — "2 millions", not "2000000"
- septante, huitante, octante and nonante are understood too
- an article is never a number: "un chien" stays put, "vingt et un chiens"
  becomes "21 chiens", and "des mille et des cents" is left alone
- anything that doesn't parse as a valid number is left exactly as dictated

Out of scope for now: decimals (the spoken "virgule" is turned into a comma
before numbers are read), ordinals ("premier" must not become "1er" in "premier
ministre"), and English.

Two settings decide how far the formatting goes:

- **Very short dictations** (`short_text_words`, off by default): below this many
  words the dictation comes out as spoken — no leading capital, no final period.
  A search field and a one-word answer are not sentences.
- **Trailing space** (`trailing_space`, off by default): ends every dictation
  with a space, so a second one does not land glued to the first.

**Filler word removal** (`cleanup_level`) strips the hesitations: "euh" and
"heu" at every level, plus verbal tics such as "ben", "genre" and "tsé" — or
"like", "basically", "actually" in English — at the high level.

Recorder backends:

- `auto`: try Python `sounddevice`, then `arecord`.
- `sounddevice`: Python recording backend.
- `arecord`: ALSA command-line recorder from `alsa-utils`.

Persistent config lives at `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/aparte/config.json`, or `~/.config/aparte/config.json` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set. Override it with `APARTE_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "default_style": "neutral",
  "cleanup_level": "medium",
  "language": "en",
  "hotwords": ["Playwright", "Wayland", "PipeWire"],
  "replacements": {
    "whisper flow": "Wispr Flow",
    "pipe wire": "PipeWire",
    "my project": "MyProject"
  },
  "snippets": {
    "signature": "Best,\nAlexandre"
  }
}
```

With that config, dictating `slash signature` expands the snippet, and dictated terms such as `pipe wire` are rewritten with the preferred spelling.

### Teaching Aparté your vocabulary

Three settings sit under **My dictionary**, and they act at three different
moments:

| Setting | Config key | When it acts |
|---|---|---|
| **My words** | `hotwords` | **before** transcription — biases Whisper itself |
| **Corrections** | `replacements` | **after**, on the text |
| **Spoken shortcuts** | `snippets` | after, expanding `slash <name>` into ready-made text |

`hotwords` and `replacements` are two different tools, not two ways of doing the
same thing. **My words** is a plain list of names — clients, tools, colleagues —
handed to Whisper up front, so it leans toward those spellings when the audio is
ambiguous. You do not need to have seen the mistake first. **Corrections** is
the safety net for what slips through anyway.

Measured on real speech: without the word list, `PipeWire` and `Mailpoet` came
out as `pipe wire` and `mail poète`; with it, both were spelled correctly,
casing included. Three names in the same sentence (`Playwright`, `Wayland`,
`Claude`) were already correct without any help — the list is for what actually
fails, not for everything you own.

Two caveats. `hotwords` only exists in `faster-whisper`; with `openai-whisper`
or `whisper.cpp` the setting is quietly ignored rather than promising what the
backend cannot deliver. And a word list makes Whisper *more* likely to hear
those words — on silence, a list containing `PipeWire` produced `PipeWire.com`
out of nothing. Keep the list to words you actually say.

**Corrections** takes one entry per line, `heard = written`. A line without an
`=` is refused, with its line number, rather than being dropped silently.
**Spoken shortcuts** takes the same form, except the text may continue on the
following lines — that is how a multi-line signature is written.

## Desktop app

`aparte desktop` starts a local server on `127.0.0.1` and opens the browser. The
interface is a focused, single-screen app:

- a large **Talk** button (browser microphone recording as WAV PCM, so no hard
  dependency on `ffmpeg`) that records, transcribes, and auto-polishes
- a transcript editor with **Polish**, **Copy**, **Insert**, and audio import
- a live preview: the text appears as you speak and keeps correcting itself
  until you stop
- a model toggle (`small` = accurate, `base` = fast); each model loads once and
  is cached, so switching is instant after first use
- a **Settings** panel (gear icon) ordered by how often a setting is actually
  touched: Dictation (language, live preview, style, filler-word removal),
  My dictionary (my words, corrections, spoken shortcuts) and French typography
  are open on arrival; Hardware (input device, beep, how to insert) and Advanced
  (default model, compute device, formatting engine, history) are folded into
  native `<details>`. Saved to the config file and applied immediately,
  including to the global-hotkey dictation flow
- a **Configuration & diagnostics** panel that shows, with green/red status, what
  is installed vs missing (Whisper backend, GPU, microphone, paste/clipboard,
  notifications) and the exact command to fix each gap — copy-paste onboarding
  for any Linux user

The interface is bilingual (English / French) with a language switch in the top
bar; it defaults to the browser language. It follows your desktop's light or dark
theme automatically, and the whole keyboard path works: `Tab` reaches every
control with a visible focus ring, `Esc` closes a panel, and animations are
skipped when your system asks for reduced motion.

The frontend lives in `src/aparte/assets/` (`index.html`, `app.css`, `app.js`,
`i18n.js`, `logo.svg`) and is served as static files, with **no build step and no
library**, so it is easy to contribute to. The design system it follows is
documented in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), and the product direction behind it in
[PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md).

## Desktop notifications

The hotkey dictation flow (`toggle` and `dictate`) shows native Linux
notifications via `notify-send` so you can tell when recording starts, when
transcription is running, and when text was inserted or copied — useful when the
command is bound to a global shortcut and no terminal is visible. Install it with
`sudo apt install libnotify-bin` if `notify-send` is missing; it is optional and
dictation works without it.

This approach avoids GTK/Qt packaging friction while staying Linux-compatible.
